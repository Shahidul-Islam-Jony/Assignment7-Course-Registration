### How I managed the state in my assignment project is described below...

(i) Firstly I import { useState } from 'react' in my component.

(ii) Then create variable or array and a function to set value in variable or array 
and set initial value of variable or array to 0 or empty array like, 
const [variable, setVariable] = useState([]);

(iii) Then I set variable or array's value from my component handleFunction by setVariable Function.

(iv) And I passed that variable or array as props to another file or components.
